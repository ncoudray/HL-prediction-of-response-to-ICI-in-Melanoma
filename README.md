# HPL-prediction-of-response-to-ICI-in-Melanoma

Use of the Histomorphological Phenotype Learning self-supervised tools to study the response to ICI in Melanoma. This repository is related to the manuscriot titled: "Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Predicts Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors." It is provided as is for research purpose and must not be use in clinical practice.

## Required packages
To run the code you need to install [DeepPATH](https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH) and [HPL](https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Histomorphological-Phenotype-Learning). 
Both pages include detailed description on the libraries to install as well as the meaning of the options used here.

The code here was developed using the slurm executor on NYU's [UltraViolet HPC cluster](https://med.nyu.edu/research/scientific-cores-shared-resources/high-performance-computing-core). The python script is therefore here given with slurm headers appropriate for this cluster as example so they could easily be adapted.
